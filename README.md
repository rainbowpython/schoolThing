# schoolThing
Made for a school asignment

WARNING: use jdk version 14 or above, I used a feature added in 14, which is not present in 8
use replit or java version 

Due to long dinner, and not so good planning, and my friend having a Scanner object issue,
I was unable to code this to its fullest
I would have liked to have implemented try-catch aswell as complete other calculators
